# Surfs_Up Module 9 Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to filter the date column of the Measurements table in a database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December, respectively. Then convert the temperatures to lists, create a Dataframe, and generate the summary statistics of the DataFrame.

## Results
June Results:

* The average temperature for June and December are 75 and 71, respectively, which is not a significant difference.
* The minimum temperature for June and December are 64 and 56, respectively, this difference would be due to the seasonal difference, the business may not be profitable in December because of the cooler weather.
* The maximum temperature for June and December are 85 and 83, respectively, which is not much of a difference. I believe that since the temperatures are very similar and moderate year-round, the business will be profitable. 


## Summary
Generally, there is not much difference between the weather in June and the weather in December. There was more data for June, although December had more of a varied dataset, ranging from 56 to 83. In all, I would assume that the weather is very similar year-round regardless of the season. To exapand, some additional queries that could be performed would be finding and analyzing the precipitation measurements for the months of June and December and calculating the average amount of precipitation for each month. Another query could be finding the closest most active station to analyze historical weather trends for the projected lcoation of the business.
